# landing-page
The 'Landing Page' assignment from The Odin Project

This project will consist of designing a landing page from 
scratch. In terms of what the landing page will consist of, I was
thinking that a satirical landing page that pokes fun at corporate
work culture could be fun, given that I *am* learning this on my own. 

I'll perhaps revist this README and reflect on what skills need to 
be developed for future projects in HTML/CSS, but for the meantime I'll leave it as is.
